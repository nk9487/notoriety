   * Week Three Assignment
   * Part One - Your assignment this week is to create a 'back' button that will
   * allow the user to return to the previous card. 
   * Part Two - The next button currently cycles through all of the available
   * cards. After adding the back button, modify the behavior so that the back
   * button is hidden when the first card is displayed and the next button is
   * hidden when the last card in the set is displayed.
   * Part Three - After our livecoding session on making a dynamic request using
   * the useEffect hook try replicating what we did on your own. To accomplish
   * this you should first create a route in Express that returns the card data
   * (the same data in src/data/cards.json) and test it using curl or Postman.
   * Next, make a request of the Express service from the useEffect hook.
